{-| A module whose text cannot be parsed, or whose header or name breaks a rule,
must be reported to the user precisely, and this module is where such failures
are described and turned into messages. The parsers of `Compiler.Parse` describe
a failure with the types here, and `toReport` turns the description into the
message the user sees.

A syntax error is a path down the grammar. Each type covers one construct, such
as a module header, a declaration, a `case` expression, a record type or a
string literal, and each of its constructors either names a way that construct
can go wrong or wraps the error of a construct nested inside it. A `CaseBranch`
error inside a `Case` inside the `DeclDefBody` of a `DeclDef` reads as: in the
body of that definition, in a branch of a `case` expression, the branch's
expression went wrong. The innermost constructor says what the problem is.

Most constructors carry a `Row` and a `Col`, counted from 1 as
`Compiler.Reporting.Annotation` describes. A constructor that wraps a nested
error with a position of its own carries the position where the parse of the
wrapped part began, which is where `Compiler.Parse.Primitives.specialize` or
`inContext` was applied. Only the innermost position is the point where the
parse stopped. A `Space`, `Char`, `String_`, `Number` or `Escape` error has no
position, and the nearest constructor around it that has one is given its
position directly by the scanner that failed, not by `specialize`.

Many types have two constructors for the same expectation, one with `Indent` in
its name. The plain one means that something other than the expected text was
found. The `Indent` one means that the next text was not indented far enough to
belong to the construct, by the layout rule `Compiler.Parse.Space` describes.

A report, a `Report.Report`, has a title, a region and a message. `toReport`
follows the path down to the innermost constructor and builds the report from
it. Its region, which is also the part marked in red in the excerpt of source
the message shows (drawn by `Compiler.Reporting.Render.Code.toSnippet`), is
usually the single column where the parse stopped, widened to a whole word,
symbol or literal where the report knows its width. Where a wrapping constructor
gives the start of the enclosing construct, the excerpt shows the
_surroundings_: the source from that start to the point of failure. Some reports
choose their advice by looking at the source text itself, at the point of
failure (`Code.whatIsNext`) or on the following line.

While it follows an expression error down, the report carries a _context_: the
chain of constructs the error lies in, from the innermost out to the definition
(`Context`), so that the message can name what was being parsed, such as "the
`foo` definition" or "a record". Patterns and types carry a smaller context,
`PContext` and `TContext`, that only changes some wording.

Most of this file is the text of those messages, one report function per type
with a branch for each constructor. The rest is the binary codecs.

`errorEncoder` and `spaceEncoder` write these values as bytes, and
`errorDecoder` and `spaceDecoder` read them back; every other error type has
an unexposed pair. A value is written as one byte, the tag, naming its
constructor, followed by the constructor's fields in order. Positions, widths
and other numbers are written with `Utils.Bytes.Encode.int`, names and strings
with `Utils.Bytes.Encode.string`, and regions with
`Compiler.Reporting.Annotation.regionEncoder`. The tags count each type's
constructors from 0 in the order they are declared. They are written out by
hand in both the encoder and the decoder, and nothing checks that the two
agree: a decoder's tag check rejects only a tag past its type's last
constructor, so bytes written under a different numbering can decode as the
wrong constructor.

{-| A syntax error in one module: either its text could not be parsed, or it
parsed but breaks a rule about its header or its name.

`ParseError` is a failure of the parse itself, located by a `Module` error. It
is the only constructor that describes a failed parse. `Builder.Elm.Details`
also builds `ParseError (ModuleBadEnd 0 0)` to mark a module blocked by a
dependency that failed, where no parse failed.

`ModuleNameUnspecified` is a module with no `module` declaration, and carries
the name it was expected to declare. Its report points at row 1, column 1 and
shows no excerpt of the source. `ModuleNameMismatch` carries the expected name
and the declared one with its region.

`UnexpectedPort` is a port declared in a module that is not a `port module`, and
`NoPorts` is a `port module` that declares no port. `NoPortsInPackage` carries
the name and region of a port declared in a package, and
`NoPortModulesInPackage` the region of a `port module` declaration in a package.
`NoEffectsOutsideKernel` is an `effect module` in a project that may not have
one.

{-| A failure to parse a module: its header, its imports, or its declarations.

`ModuleBadEnd` means that the module parser finished at the given position,
before the end of the text. Its report depends on the column: at column 1 it is
a line that does not begin a declaration, anywhere else it is unexpected text
partway along a line. `ModuleBadEnd 0 0` is also the marker of a blocked module
that `Error` describes, with no parse behind it.

`ModuleSpace` carries a whitespace error, a tab or a multi-line comment with no
end.

`ModuleProblem` is a `module` declaration that goes wrong other than in its name
or its exposing list, `ModuleName` one whose module name is missing, in a
`module` or an `effect module` declaration, and `ModuleExposing` carries an
error in its exposing list. `PortModuleProblem`, `PortModuleName` and
`PortModuleExposing` are the same for a `port module` declaration. `Effect` is
an error in an `effect module` declaration other than a missing module name or
a whitespace error, and is reported without detail.

`FreshLine` is a point in the header or among the imports where the next line
should start in column 1 and does not.

`ImportStart`, `ImportName`, `ImportAs`, `ImportAlias` and `ImportExposing` are
an import that goes wrong at the `import` keyword, the module name, the `as`
keyword, the alias and the `exposing` keyword, and `ImportExposingList` carries
an error in its exposing list. `ImportEnd` is an import followed by something
other than `as`, `exposing` or a new line. `ImportIndentName`,
`ImportIndentAlias` and `ImportIndentExposingList` are the `Indent` forms for
the module name, the alias and the exposing list.

`Infix` is any error in an infix operator declaration.

`Declarations` carries an error in the declarations. Its own position is not
used by the report.

{-| An error in a list pattern.

`PListOpen` is a point after `[` where neither a pattern nor `]` follows, and
`PListEnd` a pattern followed by something other than a comma or `]`.
`PListExpr` carries an error in an entry, and `PListSpace` a whitespace error.

`PListIndentOpen`, `PListIndentEnd` and `PListIndentExpr` are the `Indent` forms
for what follows `[`, for the closing `]`, and for an entry after a comma.

{-| An error in a type, as written in an annotation or a declaration.

`TRecord` and `TTuple` carry an error inside a record type or a parenthesised or
tuple type. `TStart` is a point where a type should begin and none does, and
`TIndentStart` is its `Indent` form. `TSpace` carries a whitespace error.

{-| An error in a record type.

`TRecordOpen` is a point after `{` where neither a field name nor `}` follows,
`TRecordField` a missing field name, and `TRecordColon` a field name not
followed by `:` (or, after the first name, by `|`). `TRecordType` carries an
error in a field's type, and `TRecordEnd` is a field type followed by
something other than a comma or `}`.
`TRecordSpace` carries a whitespace error.

`TRecordIndentOpen`, `TRecordIndentField`, `TRecordIndentColon`,
`TRecordIndentType` and `TRecordIndentEnd` are the `Indent` forms for what
follows `{`, for a field name, for the `:`, for a field's type and for the
closing `}`.

{-| An error in a parenthesised or tuple type.

`TTupleOpen` is a point after `(` where no type follows, and `TTupleEnd` a type
followed by something other than a comma or `)`. `TTupleType` carries an error
in a type inside the parentheses, and `TTupleSpace` a whitespace error.

`TTupleIndentType1`, `TTupleIndentTypeN` and `TTupleIndentEnd` are the `Indent`
forms for the first type, for a type after a comma, and for the closing `)`.

{-| An error in a character literal.

This type, like `String_`, `Number` and `Escape`, carries no position: the
nearest enclosing constructor that has a `Row` and `Col` does, and the report's
highlight starts there. For an `Escape` that is the constructor around its
`CharEscape` or `StringEscape`.

`CharEndless` is a literal whose closing `'` is not found on its line.
`CharEscape` carries an error in an escape sequence. `CharNotString` is a
literal that does not hold exactly one character, which the report takes for a
string written in single quotes. Its `Int` is the width in columns that the
report highlights.

-}
type Char
    = CharEndless
    | CharEscape Escape
    | CharNotString Int


{-| An error in a string literal.

`StringEndless_Single` is a `"` string whose closing quote is not found on its
line, and `StringEndless_Multi` a `"""` string whose closing `"""` is never
found. `StringEscape` carries an error in an escape sequence.

-}
type String_
    = StringEndless_Single
    | StringEndless_Multi
    | StringEscape Escape


{-| An error in an escape sequence in a character or string literal.

`EscapeUnknown` is a backslash followed by a character that starts no escape.
`BadUnicodeFormat` is a `\u` not followed by hexadecimal digits in curly braces.
`BadUnicodeCode` is a code point above `10FFFF`. `BadUnicodeLength` is a code
point written with fewer than four or more than six digits, and carries, after
the width, the number of digits and the code point.

The first `Int` of each of the last three is the number of columns the report
highlights from the backslash: 2 plus the number of hexadecimal digits for
`BadUnicodeFormat`, and 3 plus that number for the other two. It does not cover
a closing `}`.

-}
type Escape
    = EscapeUnknown
    | BadUnicodeFormat Int
    | BadUnicodeCode Int
    | BadUnicodeLength Int Int Int


{-| An error in a number literal.

`NumberEnd` is a number that does not end cleanly, such as one followed directly
by a letter. `NumberDot` carries the integer written before a `.` that no digit
follows. `NumberHexDigit` and `NumberBinDigit` are a bad digit in a hexadecimal
or a binary literal, and `NumberNoLeadingZero` a `0` followed by another digit.
`NumberNoLeadingOrTrailingUnderscores`, `NumberNoConsecutiveUnderscores`,
`NumberNoUnderscoresAdjacentToDecimalOrExponent`,
`NumberNoUnderscoresAdjacentToHexadecimalPreFix` and
`NumberNoUnderscoresAdjacentToBinaryPreFix` each name a place an underscore may
not go. `NumberInexactOnHost` is an integer literal whose 64-bit value the
JavaScript-hosted compiler cannot hold exactly (more than 53 significant bits);
it is reported at the start of the literal.

Every report of a `Number` error highlights the single column at its position.

-}
type Number
    = NumberEnd
    | NumberDot Int
    | NumberHexDigit
    | NumberBinDigit
    | NumberNoLeadingZero

{-| A problem in the whitespace between tokens, which includes comments.

`HasTab` is a tab character found while reading whitespace.
`EndlessMultiComment` is a multi-line comment whose end is never found.
